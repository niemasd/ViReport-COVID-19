Note: Initial guess of substitution rate not provided. Will attempt to guess starting conditions. Provide initial guesses of the rate using *omega0* parameter. 
Note: *dater* called with non binary tree. Will proceed after resolving polytomies.
Note: Minimum temporal branch length  (*minblen*) set to 0.00291146761734997. Increase *minblen* in the event of convergence failures. 
Tree is rooted. Not estimating root position.
Initial guesses of substitution rate: 3.59083163128848e-06,3.76936707650488e-06,3.97793228604647e-06,4.15864042149e-06,4.36503294080447e-06,4.54791376647511e-06 

NOTE: The p values for lineage clock rates show at least one outlying value after adjusting for multiple-testing.  This indicates a poor fit to the data for at least a portion of the phylogenetic tree. To visualize the distribution p-values, use *goodnessOfFitPlot*. 
		

The following steps may help to fix or alleviate common problems: 
* Check that the vector of sample times is correctly named and that the units are correct. 
* If passing a rooted tree, make sure that the root position was chosen correctly, or estimate the root position by passing an unrooted tree (e.g. pass ape::unroot(tree))
* The root position may be poorly estimated. Try increasing the _searchRoot_ parameter in order to test more lineages as potential root positions. 
* The model may be fitted by a relaxed or strict molecular clock. Try changing the _clock_ parameter 
* A poor fit may be due to a small number of lineages with unusual / outlying branch lengths which can occur due to sequencing error or poor alignment. Try the *outlierTips* command to identify and remove these lineages. 
* Check that there is adequate variance in sample times in order to estimate a molecular clock by doing a root-to-tip regression. Try the *rootToTipRegressionPlot* command. If the clock rate can not be reliably estimated, you can fix the value to a range using the _meanRateLimits_ option which would estimate a time tree given the previous estimate of clock rates.
