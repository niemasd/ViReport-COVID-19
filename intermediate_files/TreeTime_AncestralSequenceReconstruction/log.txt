49.60	WARNING: Previous versions of TreeTime (<0.7.0) RECONSTRUCTED sequences of
     	tips at positions with AMBIGUOUS bases. This resulted in unexpected
     	behavior is some cases and is no longer done by default. If you want to
     	replace those ambiguous sites with their most likely state, rerun with
     	`reconstruct_tip_states=True` or `--reconstruct-tip-states`.
