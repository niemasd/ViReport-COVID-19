This repository contains a molecular epidemiological report on COVID-19 produced by [ViReport](https://github.com/niemasd/ViReport) using data obtained from the [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/) database. This analysis was done using all sequences longer than 15,000 bases. As new sequences are added to the database (and as ViReport itself updates), this repository will also update.
* You can access the most up-to-date Markdown version of the report here: **[Report.md](Report.md)**
    * You can also access equivalent HTML and PDF versions here: **[Report.html](Report.html)** and **[Report.pdf](Report.pdf)**
* You can access the input sample dates here: **[input_files](input_files)**
    * I was unable to include the raw sequences due to restrictions from GISAID's terms of agreement
    * I can, however, share the FASTA upon request if given proof of ownership of a GISAID account
* You can access the output files from the analyses here: **[output_files](output_files)**
* You can access all intermediate files from the analyses here: **[intermediate_files](intermediate_files)**

Note that this is still using a ***very*** early version of [ViReport](https://github.com/niemasd/ViReport), so the aesthetics of the report will improve significantly in the next few weeks.
